A function is BLOCKING if it has to wait for smth to complete.
CPU and I/O take some time, so every function is blocking
We can't do anything to 'unblock' CPU bound tasks
But CPU is idle when we wait for results from the database server
We need to somehow use CPU to make progress, while we wait for I/O
